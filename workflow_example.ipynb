      "The Fidelity International High Dividend ETF (FIDI) is listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. and aims to provide investment returns that align with the Fidelity International High Dividend Index. The fund has no shareholder fees and an annual operating expense of 0.18%, which includes a management fee of 0.18% and no distribution or other expenses. The fund's prospectus and additional information are available online or by contacting Fidelity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document provides an example illustrating the impact of fees and expenses on investments, noting that actual fees, expenses, and returns may vary. For a $10,000 investment, total expenses upon selling shares are $18 after 1 year, $58 after 3 years, $101 after 5 years, and $230 after 10 years. The fund's portfolio turnover rate was 67% of its average portfolio value in the most recent fiscal year, indicating potential higher transaction costs and tax implications. The fund invests at least 80% of its assets in securities from the Fidelity International High Dividend IndexSM, focusing on large- and mid-cap international companies with high dividend yields. It also lends securities to generate income. Principal investment risks include stock market volatility and foreign exposure, with markets reacting differently to various developments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign markets are generally more volatile than the U.S. market due to risks such as adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign exchange rates can also be highly volatile. The fund has significant investments in Europe and Japan, making its performance closely tied to the social, political, and economic conditions in these regions, leading to higher volatility compared to more geographically diversified funds. The value of individual securities can be more volatile than the market overall, and changes in an issuer's financial condition can increase default risk, affecting security value and recovery of capital. The fund's net asset value (NAV) per share fluctuates with market value changes, and shares can trade at a premium or discount to NAV due to market volatility, disruptions, or lack of active trading. This can result in larger premiums or discounts compared to other ETFs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In stressed market conditions, the liquidity of a fund's shares may decrease due to reduced liquidity in its underlying portfolio. The fund's performance may differ from its index due to fees, transaction costs, sample selection, regulatory restrictions, and timing differences. Errors in index construction or calculation can adversely affect the fund. The fund uses a passive management strategy to track an unmanaged index, which may result in lower performance compared to actively managed funds that adjust portfolios based on market conditions. The fund's concentration will mirror that of its index in specific industries. Active trading markets for the fund's shares are not guaranteed, and trading may be halted due to market conditions. Mid-cap securities can be more volatile and perform differently from larger issuers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Securities lending carries the risk of borrowers failing to return loaned securities, potentially causing delays and costs in recovery. The fund's index aims to identify dividend-paying stocks, but there's no guarantee of success, and dividend reductions can impact income. The fund is not insured by the FDIC, and investments may result in losses. Performance data shows year-by-year returns: 15.84% in 2019, -11.65% in 2020, 17.32% in 2021, and -5.26% in 2022. Visit fidelity.com for updated performance information. Past performance does not predict future results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document provides a summary of financial returns for a specific fund. The highest quarterly return was 17.70% for the quarter ending December 31, 2022, while the lowest was -29.57% for the quarter ending March 31, 2020. For the period ending December 31, 2023, the Fidelity International High Dividend ETF had a return before taxes of 16.60% for the past year and 1.17% for the life of the fund. The return after taxes on distributions was 15.40% for the past year and 0.34% for the life of the fund. The return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares was 10.87% for the past year and 0.98% for the life of the fund. These returns are calculated using historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not account for state or local taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fund is managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, with Geode Capital Management, LLC as a sub-adviser. The portfolio managers include Louis Bottari, Peter Matthew, Navid Sohrabi, Robert Regan, and Payal Gupta, with management starting from 2018 and 2019. The MSCI World ex USA Index showed returns of 18.21% and 3.83%. Shares of the fund are traded on an exchange and can only be bought or sold through a broker at market prices, which may differ from the fund's NAV. Investors may face costs due to the bid-ask spread. More information is available on Fidelity's website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distributions from the fund are subject to federal income tax and may be taxed as ordinary income or capital gains, with potential state or local taxes, unless invested through a tax-advantaged retirement account. The fund, Adviser, Fidelity Distributors Company LLC (FDC), and affiliates may pay intermediaries, such as banks and broker-dealers, for selling fund shares and related services, which could create a conflict of interest. Fidelity Distributors Company LLC is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and more information can be found at www.sipc.org. Fidelity trademarks are owned by FMR LLC.\n"
