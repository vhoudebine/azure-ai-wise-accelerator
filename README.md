Accelerator for AI-based role play simulations on Azure

## WISE

Financial advisors, wealth managers, and investment representatives need a secure and effective way to hone their skills. They manage diverse portfolios and must be prepared to answer a wide range of questions from clients and prospects. Our AI-driven simulation platform offers a dynamic training environment where advisors can practice and receive actionable feedback to enhance their expertise.

Every year, financial services companies onboard new sellers and aim for a swift return on investment. With the constant addition of new products to their extensive portfolios, these companies need their teams to start selling immediately. Training front-office staff, support teams, and customer-facing personnel is a significant expense, often involving third-party vendors who charge thousands of dollars per trainee per week.

Our project provides a cost-effective solution, enabling advisors to train efficiently while reducing overall enablement costs for financial services companies.
